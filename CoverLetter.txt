Dear Mr. Srijan,

After going through your company's description
I am writing to express my interest in working as Intern for the Backend Engineer position, which I found posted on Wellfound. With my experience in NodeJS and MongoDb, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team.

Previously while studying NodeJS, I developed a working backend for a Voting-Booth Website. I have developed various other working backends also.

I would love to work with your company and to grow with your company.

Sincerely,  
Prasad Bhakare
