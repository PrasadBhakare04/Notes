Subject: Application for Associate Technical Support Role

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the role of Associate Technical Support at PTC. Being an undergraduate student studying for a Bachelor of Engineering in Information Technology at Sinhgad Institute of Technology and Science, I have gained solid technical skills and an interest in problem-solving in IT.

My skills are SQL, MySQL, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and resolving database and communication problems, which are in line with the needs of this position. I have worked with relational and NoSQL databases, created scalable data models, and built web APIs with Node.js and Express. Through coursework and side projects, including the Online Voting Booth and Sorting Algorithm Visualizer, I have developed my skill at diagnosing and solving technical problems effectively.

Moreover, my web development, API design, and database management experience, along with my capacity to learn new technologies rapidly, positions me well for this role. I look forward to applying my technical skills and problem-solving abilities to assist PTC's customers and help your team succeed.

I would appreciate the chance to explain why my skills and passion are suited to your requirements. Thank you for considering this application. I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
